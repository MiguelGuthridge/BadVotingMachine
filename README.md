# BadVotingMachine

This is a simple web server that acts as a voting machine. It was run on a
raspberry pi. The original server was written by Kristian Mansfield, and I
wrote code for exploiting it.

## What I did

I wrote exploits for it, which can be found in the
[`exploits/`](./exploits/README.md) directory.
